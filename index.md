My name is Natalia Teran, a chemistry major at Northern Illinois University

I am a chemistry student with a strong desire to work in the pharmaceutical industry as a medicinal chemist. 

### Background

I am a chicagoland native and started at NIU in the fall of 2024. I come from a driven and successful family of NIU alumni. My family is very important to me; without them I would not be in the place that I am today. 

Before coming to NIU, I was always interested in science, particularly chemistry. After just one high school chemistry course, I was completely captivated and wanted to learn more. Now, years later, as a chemostry student at NIU, my passion and desire to learn more has only grown. 

When I'm not in the classroom, I like helping and tutoring others in my job as a TA. In my free time, I can be found spending time with friends, watching TV, and crocheting.
