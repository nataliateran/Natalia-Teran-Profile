</# Discovering Open Source: “What is open source? What surprised me? Which well-known companies and projects use open source, and why does that matter?”

##### **What is open source?**
Open source is software that is freely available and editable to everyone. Anyone can make something and anyone can edit/improve it.

##### **What surprised me?**
The fact that anything can be edited and redistributed by anyone is something that surprised me. The idea of producing something but having to accept that anyone can change it is interesting.

##### **Which well-known companies and projects use open source, and why does that matter?**
GitHub, Amazon and Meta use open source. This is important and matters because having things in this format means anyone can edit and change things freely. Being able to do this means there is no limit to when and where people can contribute to a big project. >

</##### blog prompt: “What I learned about Markdown and Git, and how they help me contribute to open source and improve professionally. Have you use them before? What surprised you about Markdown or Git?”

##### What I learned
I learned there are many ways to use and personalize GitHub. It is possible to merge and clone files. How to do this is a little unclear to me, but I'll look into how to figure it out. 

##### Have I used this before?
I have never used this. It's all really new to me and even a little overwhelming. 

##### What surprised me about Markdown or Git?
Something I found surprising was that everyone has the ability to fork public content. >

</##### Blog Prompt: “How I chose a repository to explore and what I found interesting about its structure, community, and contribution process.”

When choosing a repository to explore, the first thing I did was compile a mental list of my interests. Once that list was made, I narrowed it down to things other people might be able to contribute to. When I came across a repository called Foodium, I had found the repository I was going to analyze. Upon further inspection of this repository, I was interested to see how the community interacts. Although the repository was definitely in its prime a few years ago, seeing the owner take on the responsibility of commenting on issues soon after they were opened and answering any questions that came up. As for the structure of the repository, I was pleased to see it was easy to follow and that there were a bunch of beginner-friendly tags in the issues section. As part of the read-me section, there were clear instructions about how to contribute to the repository; this was also nice to see. >

</##### After exploring Reveal.js, describe how it’s structured, what it’s for, and what you found interesting about the way the project is documented and maintained. Could you imagine yourself contributing to this? Why or why not?

After exploring this repository, I see that it is structured in an organized way. Above the read me, there is a nice, organized list with different things in the repository. In the read me, there is a clear description stating what the repository us about. Within this section, there are several hyperlinks with descriptions to the different features. Likewise, there are some tabs at the top with pull requests, issues, and other important aspects of the repository. 

This repository is an open source HTML presentation framework. By using it, anyone can create a presentation free of charge. 

The documentation of this repository is also organized and very detailed. Something I found interesting was the way the owner as well as the community communicate. The most recent activity in the repository was 2 weeks ago (pull request)


I could not imagine myself contributing ti this repository as i am not sure what I would contribute. However, the repository has clear instructions on how to contribute to the repository. >

</### **Reflect on something you learned about open source licenses (e.g., MIT vs GPL, what’s allowed, what’s restricted).**

I learned that MIT licenses are the most common license and they are also the shortest. When speaking, Mr. Mark said they are not very long in length and as a lawyer, that makes him upset haha. Both the MIU and BSD licenses allow reuse in proprietary and commercial software. In MIT licenses, it isn't clear if patent rights are waived or included, and in BSD licenses, the inclusion of a copyright notice is required, and advertising acknowledgements may be required as well. 

##### **How did the Tetris movie shape your understanding of software ownership and distribution?**

The tetris movie was super interesting. I loved learning about what goes into software ownership. In the movie, when they were discussing who owned the game and who truly had the right to distribute it, there was a lot of blackmail involved as well as a bunch of legal issues. While I feel like most cases do not involve as much drama and violence, there is quite a bit that has to happen and be in place before a company can say they own a game.

##### **What surprised or intrigued you about NIU’s approach to IP, patents, and tech transfer?**

Something that surprised me was that if a student produces or invents something on the NIU campus, the student themself owns and has the rights to it. Of course, there are some limitations, such as the recourses used and whether or not the student is being paid to invent things, but most of the time, the student owns their own invention.

#####**How do you think licensing empowers or complicates open innovation?**

Licensing can complicate open innovation as it can get very messy like it did in the movie. Sometimes if a company is trying to get a license, they might face a lot of hardships like fighting with another company to get a patent first. As discussed in class, it is a bit of a race. Whichever company is the first to the patent office and files it effectively "wins" the race. 

##### **Bonus: Can you find and interpret the license used in a project you’re interested in contributing to?**

The repository, verbecc (https://github.com/bretttolbert/verbecc?tab=LGPL-3.0-1-ov-file) has a LGPL license. This means the license is more lenient and has more permissions than a GPL license, but is not as lenient as a MIT license. >

</### Blog Prompt: “My experience participating in MLH Global Hack Week: what I learned, what I contributed, and who I connected with.”

#### Write about:
> 1) What you learned from participating in MLH Global Hack Week
> 2) What contribution (or challenge) you made
> 3) Who you connected with or learned from
> 4) How this experience shaped your view of open source collaboration

1) During global hack week, I learned a lot more about how open source repositories work. In joining and participating in the GHW Open Source] Understanding Open Source Repos event, I learned more about how pull requests work and what they are for. In class, i was never able to really understand what they were, but after attending this live stream, I now know that they are typically used for merging different branches together to make sure there is no branch that has any more commits than the main branch, or as it is stated in GitHub, none of the branches are any "commits ahead" of the main branch. 

2) The challenge I did was called Complete the GitHub Copilot Prompt Quest ((https://mlh.link/ghwos25-github-quest1?utm_source=mlh&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Master+prompt+crafting%3A+Refine+code+with+Copilot)). This challenge explored how AI (copilot) is and can be used to generate code. this challenge was interesting as it allowed me to see the code that goes into a repository and how different commands affect the output. I learned that when a broader command is put in, the code that is generated is a lot less specific than it would be with a more specific command. When more specific commands are put into the AI, the code that is generated is a lot more specific. It was in this challenge that I really learned how pull requests work. This happened as a result of having to create and merge a pull request. the challenge would not let me go on to the next step without performing the previous one correctly, so I quickly learned how to correctly create and merge a pull request, and because of the way I had to do it, I'm sure I'll never forget how again. 

3) The leader of the live stream I watched was a young lady named Varshini. She attends rice university and was very passionate about everything she was talking about. It was easy to see that she really enjoys working with repositories and wants other people to have the same positive experiences she does. From her, I learned about the public-apis repository (https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). Varshini said that this repository was a good example of a well thought-out and well-organized repository and then proceeded to give everyone a detailed tour of it while explaining what everything was for. She explained the different types of licenses and what they all mean, focusing on the MIT license, as that was the license this repository has. 

4) By the end of this live stream, we had talked about a lot of things previously mentioned in class, but in a different way. the way everything was discussed in this video was clear, detailed, and very beginner-friendly, which is something I really needed and appreciated. All in all, this experience shaped my view of open source collaboration in the sense that I now have a better idea of how everything works. After leaving the live stream yesterday, I am a lot more confident in my understanding of what different types of licenses mean, how to contribute to a repository, and most notably, how pull requests work and how to create them. >
